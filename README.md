# üìù Full Stack ParallelChain Coding Test 

# The Challenge
You have to build a To-Do List front-end application in <b>NextJS 14</b> with <b>Typescript</b>. You will also need to build a backend in <b>Django</b> and create a mock database with <b>PostgreSQL</b>.

Utilize the Server Components in Next 14 and make sure your API calls are organized well, typesafe (include schemas, etc), and use RESTFUL.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Requirements
Your app needs to fulfill these criteria:
- Tech Stack: <b>Next 14 as frontend, Django as backend, and PostgreSQL as database</b>
- Styling: <b>Tailwind CSS</b>
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Include Loading UI fallback on the frontend
- Deploy the frontend in <b>Vercel</b>
- Deploy the backend, ideally in <b>AWS</b>, but if it is not possible, you can consider using <a href="https://docs.render.com/free">Render</a>.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus
You can implement more features. Depending on your experience and time, these are some ideas that you may consider to add in your application.
 - Implement JWT Authentication to redirect the app (with middleware) to sign-in page & signed-in page & store the tokens in local storage / cookies
 - Pagination for to-do list, 10 to-dos per page
 - Sort to-do by id with ascending and descending
 - Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
 - Loading the next batch of to-dos when user has reached the end of the screen
